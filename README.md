#**Simple Compass Android:**
------------------
An Android app that displays compass headings.

## Disclaimer:
This project was started purely as a "proof of concept".
I built this project for personal use and, above all else, as a learning tool. The designs are aimed at what I wanted to achieve, thus may not be perfect for everyone. 
No guarantee that it is 100% accurate, but seems to be fairly close. Use at your own risk.


-----------------------

### Use:
Honestly I think I've made the app fairly intuitive. The red button turns on / off the compass reading.
Hold the device flat down for the compass to read.
